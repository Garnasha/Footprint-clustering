###RNA and Protein

The most interesting of those chemicals in terms of complexity of form
and function are RNA and proteins. These are nature's nanobots, and they
fulfill a staggering variety of roles. Both are heteropolymers, meaning
they are created by linking a long string of similar but different
molecules together into a single comparatively huge molecule, its
functionality given by the exact sequence used to make it. For purposes
of this paper, we can think of them as words over a specific alphabet
(sequences). For proteins, this is an alphabet of 21 amino acids. For
RNA, the alphabet is that of the nucleotides A, C, U, G.

####Strengths, weaknesses and synthesis of Protein
Proteins, with their varied alphabet, can be bent to a wide variety of
tasks, but their lifetime is limited and amino acids don't offer a
convenient way to implement a straightforward mechanism to replicate a
sequence.

As a result, new proteins are synthesized by translation from RNA
strings, every 3 letters of RNA encoding 1 amino acid ($4^2 = 16 < 21 <
64 = 4^3$). We will not discuss this further, but note that *to produce a
protein, a template RNA strand is needed*.

####Strengths, weaknesses and replication of RNA
RNA is slightly less convenient for general-purpose tasks, but
nucleotides form weak, temporary bonds in pairs: A with U, C with G.
This enables a replication mechanism: only polymerize (add letters)
while both the forming string and the nucleotide to be added are matched
pointwise by a fully formed string, resulting in a "negative" of the
original. By taking the negative of a negative, the original is
replicated faithfully.

However, this process is not perfect, and in the long term, making
copies of copies, transcription errors will accumulate, reducing or
destroying efficacy of the resulting RNA. Additionally, RNA isn't
extremely stable, and will eventually degrade, like protein, and for the
same reason: stability and general-purpose reactivity are conflicting
properties.


###DNA

####DNA as a more stable form of RNA
To solve the issue of short-livedness and imperfect replication, a third
type of molecule is used: DNA. This is a close cousin to RNA, but
altered chemically to favour longevity over utility. Additionally, U
(Uracil) specifically is replaced by T (Thymine), which matches A more
reliably and is generally more chemically stable.

####Stability features
Pair bonding is stronger, and semi-permanent, resulting in
double-stranded strings of matching DNA, each strand the other's
negative. As a result, the freeform shape of RNA giving rise to its
general-purpose utility is replaced in DNA by a double helix, which only
contributes stability. Also, the permanent availability of a negative
allows some degree of error detection and correction. All this makes DNA
more or less inert, unaffected by and unable to affect most parts of its
environment.

####Transcription to RNA
What is preserved, however, is the ability to pair-bond, even with RNA.
This allows DNA to act as long-term sequence storage: By temporary
opening of the double strand (breaking the internal pair-bonds), RNA can
be **transcribed** from a reliable DNA template. This RNA can then in
itself perform some general task, or be translated into protein.
