#Introduction
In this thesis, we will be looking at the mathematical formalisation of
a biological problem concerning DNA regulation, and attempt a solution.
As this is a multidisciplinary thesis, we will pay rather more attention
than is customary to basic background of the subjects involved, both in
the main text and in appendices.

##Structure of this text
We will first formulate our research question in terms which are
intuitive for biologists. Before trying to solve the problem, we will
establish some biological background and characterize the content and
format of our dataset. Based on this, we will construct a suitable
model, and reformulate the research question in terms of the formalism
of our model, accessible for data scientists.  The answer to the formal
question should translate trivially to an answer to the original,
biological phrasing of the question. Finally, we will describe an
attempted solution, and discuss the results.
