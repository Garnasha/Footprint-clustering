#Acknowledgements
I would like to thank my thesis supervisors, Wieb Bosma of the Radboud
University FNWI department for mathematics, and Colin Logie of the RIMLS
FNW-Molecular biology department, for their advice, expertise, feedback,
and general guidance throughout the writing of this thesis. 

I would like to thank Sadia Saeed, for her stellar work at Colin Logie's
group producing the dataset used in this thesis, and for very generously
sharing said dataset. Since this dataset is based on the analysis of
white blood cells, I would also like to thank the anonymous blood donors
who consented for their blood to be analysed for this purpose.  

I would like to thank Kees Albers and Wout Megchelenbrink, for sharing
their expertise and providing valuable feedback.

I would also like to thank the various people I have discussed this
thesis with in passing, many of them at the FNWI department for computer
science, most of whose names I've never even known, but whose
perspectives have proven valuable in writing this thesis.

Finally, I would like to thank the Genome Reference Consortium, for publicly
and freely providing a human reference genome, which, while less
personal, has also been indispensable in writing this thesis.
