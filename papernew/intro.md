#Introduction
In this thesis, we will be looking at the mathematical formalisation of
a biological problem concerning DNA regulation, and attempt a solution.
As this is a multidisciplinary thesis, we will pay rather more attention
than is customary to basic background of the subjects involved.

##Structure of this text
We will first formulate our research question from a biological
perspecive. Before trying to solve the problem, we will establish some
biological background and characterize the content and format of our
dataset. Based on this, we will construct a suitable model, and
reformulate the research question in terms of the formalism of our
model, accessible for data scientists.  The answer to the formal
question should translate trivially to an answer to the original,
biological phrasing of the question. Finally, we will describe an
attempted solution, and discuss the results.
